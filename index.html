                            <h3>Drifting</h3>
                                <p>My passion for drifting has been a journey fueled by my love for cars. Ever since I can 
                                    remember, I would take every car game I owned and experiment with making the cars slide, 
                                    trying to replicate that thrilling sensation. I had known about drifting as a real-life 
                                    sport for a while, but it wasn't until 2021 that I truly began to pay attention. The 
                                    turning point came in 2023 when I attended my first Formula Drift event at Road Atlanta, 
                                    and from that moment, I was hooked. The excitement of watching skilled drivers navigate 
                                    the track with precision and flair ignited a fire within me. I returned to Road Atlanta 
                                    in 2024 and even had the opportunity to experience the action at Formula Drift Orlando, 
                                    solidifying my love for this exhilarating sport. One day, I hope to earn my own spot on 
                                    the Formula Drift roster and compete among the best in the sport.</p>

                            <p>Creating sim drifting content is a true passion of mine, where the thrill of racing meets the 
                                art of precision driving. The virtual world allows me to explore intricate techniques and 
                                push the limits of whatâ€™s possible, all while connecting with a vibrant community of fellow 
                                enthusiasts. I love crafting engaging videos that showcase not just the adrenaline rush of 
                                drifting, but also the creativity involved in car customization and track selection. Sharing
                                 my journey, tips, and experiences inspires others to dive into the exhilarating realm of sim 
                                 drifting, and it fuels my desire to continue honing my skills and artistry in this exciting space.</p>

                            <h3>My Sim Setup</h3>
                            <p>My sim racing setup offers an incredibly realistic experience, closely mimicking the feel of 
                                driving a real car. The MOZA R9 Wheel Base delivers precise force feedback, allowing me to 
                                sense the road's texture and the car's dynamics, making each drift feel authentic. Coupled 
                                with the MOZA CRP Pedals, which provide responsive and adjustable resistance, I can truly 
                                gauge braking and acceleration, enhancing my control. The MOZA Sequential and H-pattern shifters 
                                allow for smooth gear transitions, while my custom-built handbrake gives me the ability to 
                                initiate drifts with confidence. Together, this equipment creates an immersive environment 
                                that not only sharpens my skills but also captures the thrill and excitement of real-world driving.</p>
