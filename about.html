    <h1>About This Website</h1>
    <p>This Website was Developed for the Class IT3203: Intro to Web Developement. 
        This project will be updated throughout the semester as new content and methods
        are learned. Iteration one covers the basics of HTML CSS and JavaScript and Focus 
        on a clean, user-friendly design website. The site will also include Add basic 
        interactivity using JavaScript such as form validation and toggling elements.
        I have even implemented some things I have learned outside of D2L. To Be Continued...

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Drake Burke and I am on my final year at Kennesaw State University. I will 
        be graduating in the spring with a Bachelors Degree in Cyber Security. I have always been 
        fascinated with computers, and have seen the trouble that comes with the technology. I 
        chose Cyber Security as my career choice because I want to make a difference in the Cyber 
        world. I hope to one day work for a company that stops or prevents these criminals from 
        making the cyber world an unsafe place.
