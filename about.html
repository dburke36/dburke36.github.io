            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My name is Drake Burke and I am on my final year at Kennesaw State University. I will 
            be graduating in the spring with a Bachelors Degree in Cyber Security. I have always been 
            fascinated with computers, and have seen the trouble that comes with the technology. I 
            chose Cyber Security as my career choice because I want to make a difference in the Cyber 
            world. I hope to one day work for a company that stops or prevents these criminals from 
            making the cyber world an unsafe place.</p>

            <p>I also have a deep passion for gaming, especially 
                in the realm of sim racing and sim drifting. Ever since I first got behind a 
                virtual wheel, I've been hooked on the thrill of competitive racing. This passion 
                has driven me to create content that brings together fellow enthusiasts from around 
                the world, where we can share tips, strategies, and experiences.</p>

            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>I've had the incredible opportunity to attend multiple Formula Drift events, including 
                one at my local track, Road Atlanta, and another at Orlando Speed World in Florida. These 
                events fueled my passion for drifting and motorsports even more. Recently, I also competed
                in my first virtual drift competition, which was a thrilling experience as I got to put 
                my skills to the test in a competitive setting.</p>

            <p>This past summer, I visited Los Angeles for the first time, which was also my first-ever 
                experience flying. While in LA, I checked off a huge bucket list item by watching my 
                favorite baseball team, the LA Dodgers, play at Dodger Stadium—a memory I’ll never forget!</p>
                
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p> With a background in gaming and an ever-growing fascination for motorsports, I've 
            spent countless hours fine-tuning my skills. Whether it's perfecting my drifts or 
            chasing that perfect lap time, my goal is to bring authentic, engaging, and informative 
            content to my audience. I strive to make my streams and videos not only entertaining 
            but also a learning resource for everyone who shares my passion.</p>
        
            <p>Looking ahead, I plan to continue growing my community, building connections with 
            like-minded individuals, and pushing the limits of what's possible in the world of 
            sim racing. I'm always excited to see what the future holds, and I look forward to 
            sharing every lap of this journey with you!</p>
